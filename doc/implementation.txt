com.zybnet.abc: main activity, Log code
com.zybnet.abc.view
com.zybnet.abc.model: POJO

The database is entirely loaded in memory at startup

The central node in the database is the Slot (* is optional):
 - subject REQUIRED
 - start (defaults to 8:00 + 1hr * column)
 - end (defaults to start + 1hr)
 - row (for displaying purposes)
 - column (for displaying purposes)
 - where * (defaults to "Nowhere")
 - teacher * (defaults to "Nobody")

Other entities involved:
 - Teacher (is a phone contact)
 - Subject
   - name
   - name_short (for displaying in UI)
   - default_teacher (copied to slot)
   - default_where (copied to slot)
 - Test
   - description
   - date
   - score
 - Homework
   - description
   - due

The application requires CRUD UI for: Subject, Homework and Test. Teacher is
a phone contact, thus UI is managed by the system.

Slot fields are set by:
 - the program (row, column)
 - the user (start, end, where)
 - references to other entities (subject, teacher)
The layout for Slot doesn't display row and column (a title is derived from
these pieces of data). All of the other fields are contained in a vertical
layout. When the user clicks an item, a transition brings the user to either:
 - an edit form (start-end, where) with two buttons OK and Back
 - a ListView with entities (subject, teacher). Below the ListView there are
   two buttons for "New" and "Back". Clicking selects the item, long clicking
   brings the user to the "Edit" interface (this is advertised below the title)

To be concise we define an `EntityView`. This view can be used to
 - list items and creating new ones (Test, Homework)
 - pick items (Teacher)
The difference is only that items in the former list are not selectable (there
is no OnClickListener, only long clicks for editing are observed)
